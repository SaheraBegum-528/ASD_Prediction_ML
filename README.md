A Machine Learning Model tO predicts Autism Spectrum Disorder
# ðŸ§  Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction using Machine Learning

Predicting autism early can make a life-changing impact â€” this project leverages the power of machine learning to assist in early detection using behavioral and medical features.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses supervised learning algorithms to analyze and predict the possibility of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in individuals based on questionnaire-based inputs and personal traits.

It is built as a part of my Final Year B.Tech project to demonstrate how machine learning can contribute to healthcare diagnostics in a simple, interpretable way.
